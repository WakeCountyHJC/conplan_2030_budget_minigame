                <p>In this game, you can describe how you would distribute the funds allocated by the
                    City of Raleigh to the 2026-2030 Consolidated Plan. We
                    present the five funding &#8220;buckets&#8221; defined from their literature and
                    challenge you to find a fair allocation of funds among them.</p>
